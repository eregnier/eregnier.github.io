Presentation
============

I do code. I love technology.

One of my main hobbies is to experiment technologies, stay up to date. I manage most of my side projects beside my main job where I use some `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to manage my production.

I did and I do a lot of self hosting services / websites. I learned many things about software architecture, build, and lifecycle.

In case you are looking at what I can do the best, You may know that my github account is pretty empty because I have my own private `gitlab <https://gitlab.utopland.net/>`_ and because until now I always found everything I needed for my projects as open source software. That's why I have no significant useful open source projet.
