Presentation
============

I do code. I love technology.

One of my main hobbies is to experiment technologies. I manage many side projects beside my main job where I use some `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to manage my production.

I did and I do a lot of self hosting services / websites. That teached me many things about software build, architecture and lifecycle.

In case you are looking at what I can do the best, I let you know that my github account is pretty empty because I have my own private `gitlab <https://gitlab.utopland.net/>`_ and because until now I always found everything I needed for my projects as open source software. That's why I have no significant useful open source projet.


Python
------

I started to contribute to the `python documentation translation to french <https://github.com/python/python-docs-fr>`_. This is where I think I can do usefull open source software contribution. I hope one day, I will contribute to cpython directly.

I started developping with PHP and later with symfony. Discovering such a stack - framework concept, ORM, microservices - was really exciting. but once I discovered Python, then `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. It became my favourite programming language/framework then I did a lot of web development. I learn many things. Now I focus a lot on `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_. This is mainly because we use it at `jaccede <https://www.jaccede.com/>`_ (my current job).

And oh, with this job I learnt a lot about distributed softwares, `sqlalchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, performance issues for the web using high level python/flask tools for `redis <https://redis.io/>`_ caching for the real world of production services.

Two more things about my exiting experience of python world is that i wrote an `aws lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/?nc1=h_ls>`_ program that produces all sizes for our user images. It was a really great project. More recently I had the joy to play around with `crossbar.io/autobahn <https://crossbar.io/>`_ that is a message broker. We use it for our messaging system.

Javascript
----------

Another important point in my search of performance, because tweaking and make software perform efficiently is something I like to do a lot are my recent activities around our frontend stack. We have a "legacy" `angular js <https://angularjs.org/>`_ frontend web app that I bundled using `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`_ on december 2017.

We may switch our codebase to `vue js <https://vuejs.org/>`_  in 2018 with in mind performance improvements. This would be possible because our codebase is not that big, and althrought we have a single page application our website remain simple.

This led me to understand how noweday a node stack work and have to be managed. and brought me back to fundamentals concerns that are web pages footprints.

This is a quick sum up of my recent activity at the end of this 2017 year. I hope, and I know 2018 will bring me a lot of new challenges. It smells `cordova <https://cordova.apache.org/>`_ hybrid apps out there ! (or maybe `pwa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app>`_ ?)
