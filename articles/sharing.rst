I am happy and proud of my friends that have a link with IT. I always enjoy sharing ideas or teach them whenever possible. Here is most of my everyday motivation.

`pyglouthon <https://github.com/SBillion>`_ He is my colleage and he teached me a lot these past years about API conventions, HTTP fundamentals, AWS management and web best practices for many topics like SEO.

`Lo√Øc <https://loicparent.fr>`_ is my most pro active padawan. He is a self made man and has a Phd in chemistry. He converted hisself in computing science mostly in 2017 and ended by finding his first job in an IT company. I am really proud of him :)

`Gwenaelp <https://gwenaelp.github.io>`_ he is an ex colleage travelling around the world with whome I share a lot of ideas around javascript ecosystem. He learned me a lot in modular software development where I had lacks when I started working @ `Capensis <https://capensis.fr>`_

`Dyo <#>`_ She is a very courageous student that has a degree in oneology but did not succed finding a job. So she started again some studies in IT. She is my new padawan these days.

I also spend some time on the #python-fr irc chanel and my nickname is utopman.
