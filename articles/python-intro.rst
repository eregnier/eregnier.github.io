I started to contribute to the `python documentation translation to french <https://github.com/python/python-docs-fr>`_. This is where I think I can do usefull open source software contribution. I hope one day, I will contribute to cpython directly.

I started developping with PHP and later with symfony. Discovering such a stack - framework concept, ORM, microservices - was really exciting. but once I discovered Python, then `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. It became my favourite programming language/framework then I did a lot of web development. I learn many things. Now I focus a lot on `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_. This is mainly because we use it at `jaccede <https://www.jaccede.com/>`_ (my current job).

And oh, with this job I learnt a lot about distributed softwares, `sqlalchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, performance issues for the web using high level python/flask tools for `redis <https://redis.io/>`_ caching for the real world of production services.

Two more things about my exiting experience of python world is that i wrote an `aws lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/?nc1=h_ls>`_ program that produces all sizes for our user images. It was a really great project. More recently I had the joy to play around with `crossbar.io/autobahn <https://crossbar.io/>`_ that is a message broker. We use it for our messaging system.
