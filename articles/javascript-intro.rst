Another important point in my search of performance, because tweaking and make software perform efficiently is something I like to do a lot are my recent activities around our frontend stack. We have a "legacy" `angular js <https://angularjs.org/>`_ frontend web app that I bundled using `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`_ on december 2017.

We may switch our codebase to `vue js <https://vuejs.org/>`_  in 2018 with in mind performance improvements. This would be possible because our codebase is not that big, and althrought we have a single page application our website remain simple.

This led me to understand how noweday a node stack work and have to be managed. and brought me back to fundamentals concerns that are web pages footprints.

This is a quick sum up of my recent activity at the end of this 2017 year. I hope, and I know 2018 will bring me a lot of new challenges. It smells `cordova <https://cordova.apache.org/>`_ hybrid apps out there ! (or maybe `pwa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app>`_ ?)
